Notes about systemd sandboxing
------------------------------

CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_SYS_ADMIN is needed to get the btrfs default
subvolume id.

ProtectClock=true breaks LVM - strange.

CAP_SYS_MODULE is needed for LVM (creating snapshots, loads
dm_snapshot).

ProtectKernelModules=true breaks LVM.

CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_SYS_NICE is also needed by LVM.

ProtectHome=true, ProtectControlGroups=true, ProtectKernelLogs=true,
ProtectKernelTunables=true and PrivateMounts=yes breaks diff for LVM.

SystemCallFilter=@mount breaks almost everything with older systemd,
e.g. on SLE15 SP1.

CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_FOWNER is needed if for home directories.

CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE is needed for directory
comparison (in some cases) - but not if using btrfs send/receive.

Finally do not forget the hooks.

Have a lot of fun...
