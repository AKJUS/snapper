Distinguish to modi operandi:

With DBus:

- Access to snapshot metadata (info.xml) and filelist is takes care of
  by snapperd.

Without DBus:

- In general only works when snapper is run by root.


File and directory permissions:

The .snapshots directory must be readable by those allowed to work
with the snapper config. This is required even though the DBus
interface is used since some operations (e.g. diff and undochange) are
always done by snapper (not snapperd).

snapper creates .snapshots with access only allowed for root.

snapper can setup ACLs for access for .snapshots.


Giving users access to work with a snapper config may allow them to
see directory and file content in areas they would otherwise not be
allowed to see.


info.xml may be readable by all. Only writeable by root.

filelists may be readable by all. Only writeable by root.
