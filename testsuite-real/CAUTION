CAUTION
-------

RUN THESE TESTS IN A SCRATCH MACHINE.

Most tests in this directory only work when run as the root user.

They operate
- on a scratch BTRFS filesystem (`/testsuite`)
- created in a loopback-mounted file (`/testsuite-of-snapper.img`),
- using a scratch Snapper configuration (`testsuite`).

However bugs do happen so it is recommended that you
run these tests in a scratch machine. A bug may cause
LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF YOUR OWN BTRFS SNAPSHOTS AND DATA.

See `setup-and-run-all` for the scratch setup and `run-all` for the actual
test set.

The tests conform to the Test Anything Protocol (sloppily).
`prove setup-and-run-all` works.
